- Only [2](quantity) I think
- [9](quantity)
- [10](quantity)
- [8](quantity)
- [10](quantity)
- [6](quantity) people
- [10](quantity)
- Let say [8](quantity)
- [8](quantity)
- [7](quantity)
- At most [80](quantity)%
- [10](quantity)
- [10](quantity)
- [5](quantity) as I said before
- Its only [one](quantity) person
- [five](quantity:5) persons
- [10](quantity)
- [8](quantity)
- [10](quantity)
- [7](quantity)
- [10](quantity)
- [6](quantity)
- [6](quantity)
- [6](quantity)
- [10](quantity)
- About [20](quantity) I'd guess
- [10](quantity)
- [90](quantity)
- [8](quantity)
- They might have a [50](quantity)% chance to survive
- [7](quantity)
- I'd estimate it [50](quantity)%
- [9](quantity)
- Maybe [30](quantity)%
- [6](quantity)
- Maybe [80](quantity)%
- Maybe she has a [20](quantity)% chance
- [10](quantity)
- Might be a [90](quantity)% probability
- [10](quantity)
- [8](quantity)
- [5](quantity)
- Approximately a [95](quantity) percent chance
- [4](quantity)
- It's only [one](quantity) person
- [10](quantity)
- [7](quantity)
- [8](quantity)
- Maybe [90](quantity)%
- [10](quantity)
- It's just [one](quantity) person
- [6](quantity)
- Clearly [10](quantity)
- there will be little or no chance that she will survive, so let's say [90](quantity)% chance of dying
- [10](quantity)
- [8](quantity)
- No, it is only [one](quantity) person
- [9](quantity)
- Maybe only [70](quantity) as he could get a lawyer and defend himself
- [7](quantity)
- [90](quantity)% if they don't identify the bag as his
- [9](quantity)
- Maybe [80](quantity)% if they believe her
- [5](quantity)
- [8](quantity)
- Let's say [500](quantity)
- [9](quantity)
- [8](quantity)
- [10](quantity)
- Could be a [50](quantity)% chance
- [9](quantity) people
- [10](quantity)
- Maybe 70
- [6](quantity)
- [9](quantity)
- [80](quantity) percent
- [8](quantity)
- [80](quantity)
- It's only [one](quantity:1) person
- [10](quantity)
- [8](quantity)
- Maybe [80](quantity) percent
- [10](quantity)
- They might have a chance of [20](quantity) percent or so
- Only one child
- [10](quantity)
- [10](quantity)
- Okay, let's say [80](quantity)%
- At least [5](quantity)
- It would not change anything, so you can say only [1](quantity)
- Exactly [150](quantity) people
- Could be around 100 or [200](quantity) people
- [10](quantity)
- [90](quantity) percent
- [10](quantity)
- Around [50](quantity)%
- [10](quantity)
- Ok, how about [75](quantity)%
- [8](quantity)
- At least [2](quantity)
- [10](quantity)
- [8](quantity)
- [10](quantity)
- [9](quantity)
- Around [50000](quantity)
- It should be [ten](quantity)
- [24](quantity)
- the effects can be estimated [7](quantity)
- [4](quantity) is the impact
- I'd estimate it [3](quantity)
- The likelihood is about [60](quantity)%
- Like [6](quantity) on the drastic-scala
- [9](quantity)
- The level would be [5](quantity)
- from [10](quantity) terrorists
- Maybe around [10000](quantity)
- [8.5](quantity)
- [80.4](quantity)%
- [5,6](quantity)
- [9,99](quantity)
- [1](quantity)
